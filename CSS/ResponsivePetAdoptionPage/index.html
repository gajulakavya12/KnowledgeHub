            <h3>Meet Snoopy</h3>
            <p>Snoopy is a clever and well-mannered pet, the best I've ever had. As I'm leaving India, I want to ensure that Snoopy is cared for by someone here who can give her the love and affection she deserves. I'm looking for a genuine pet lover who would cherish having her as part of their family.Snoopy loves spending time with children and brings so much joy to them. If you have children, it's even better, as they're sure to enjoy her company, especially because she interacts with them in such a playful and delightful way.If you're interested and feel you can provide a loving home, I'd be happy to consider giving her to you.</p>

            <h3>Meet Mac</h3>
            <p>Mac is a bright and charming parrot with a wonderful personality. As I prepare to leave India, I want to find a loving and responsible home where he will be well cared for and appreciated.
            Mac is very sociable and enjoys interacting with people, especially children. His cheerful chatter and playful antics can bring life and laughter to any home. If your family loves birds and has the time to engage with him, Mac will make a fantastic companion.If you're a bird lover looking for a delightful addition to your family, I'd be happy to discuss giving Mac to you.</p>
